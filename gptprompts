ChatGPT Prompt - 

I want to create a very simple mac app that has a simple UI where it prompts me to select a solder on my local drive, and once I select it, it finds the files named following.html and followers_1.html

After it reads all the data in both of them (in HTML), it makes and shows me a list of people which do not follow me.

To get you started, here's a basic outline of how you can achieve this in Swift for macOS. This app would use the Cocoa framework for the UI and file handling.

Steps to Create the App
Set up the UI: Use a simple window with a button to prompt the user to select a folder.
File Selection: Once the folder is selected, search for following.html and followers_1.html.
Parse HTML Files: Use HTML parsing to extract usernames or other identifiers.
Compare Followers and Following: Find users who don‚Äôt follow back.
Display Results: Show the list of non-followers.
Here's a basic code outline for these tasks:

1. Create the UI and Prompt for Folder Selection
In Swift, you can use NSOpenPanel to prompt the user to select a folder.

swift
Copy code
import Cocoa

class ViewController: NSViewController {
    
    @IBAction func selectFolder(_ sender: Any) {
        let dialog = NSOpenPanel()
        dialog.title = "Choose a folder"
        dialog.canChooseDirectories = true
        dialog.canChooseFiles = false
        dialog.allowsMultipleSelection = false
        
        if dialog.runModal() == .OK, let url = dialog.url {
            processFiles(in: url)
        }
    }
    
    func processFiles(in folderURL: URL) {
        // Find and read following.html and followers_1.html files here
    }
}
2. Locate and Read the HTML Files
You can look for the files in the selected folder.

swift
Copy code
func processFiles(in folderURL: URL) {
    let followingPath = folderURL.appendingPathComponent("following.html")
    let followersPath = folderURL.appendingPathComponent("followers_1.html")
    
    guard let followingData = try? String(contentsOf: followingPath),
          let followersData = try? String(contentsOf: followersPath) else {
        print("Error reading files")
        return
    }
    
    let followingList = extractUsernames(from: followingData)
    let followersList = extractUsernames(from: followersData)
    
    let nonFollowers = followingList.subtracting(followersList)
    displayNonFollowers(nonFollowers)
}
3. Extract Usernames from HTML
If the HTML files contain usernames in a straightforward format, you might use regular expressions to extract them. Swift‚Äôs NSRegularExpression can handle this, but be cautious with HTML parsing.

swift
Copy code
func extractUsernames(from htmlData: String) -> Set<String> {
    let pattern = "regex_pattern_for_usernames" // Define your regex for usernames
    var usernames = Set<String>()
    
    let regex = try? NSRegularExpression(pattern: pattern)
    let matches = regex?.matches(in: htmlData, range: NSRange(htmlData.startIndex..., in: htmlData))
    
    matches?.forEach {
        if let range = Range($0.range, in: htmlData) {
            usernames.insert(String(htmlData[range]))
        }
    }
    
    return usernames
}
4. Display the List of Non-Followers
For a simple display, you could use a NSTextView or NSTableView to show the non-followers list in the main window.

swift
Copy code
func displayNonFollowers(_ nonFollowers: Set<String>) {
    // Display non-followers in the app‚Äôs UI (e.g., using NSTextView or NSTableView)
}
Additional Tips
Error Handling: Make sure to handle cases where files might not exist or contain unexpected data.
HTML Parsing: Depending on the complexity of following.html and followers_1.html, a more robust HTML parsing library like SwiftSoup might help.
This outline should help you get started with the core functionality. Let me know if you need more specifics on any part!

Thank you! Is there an easier or same option to do make this app in Python and if so, give me the source code

You can create a similar macOS app using Python with the help of the tkinter library for the UI and beautifulsoup4 for HTML parsing. This will provide a simple cross-platform interface and make it easier to parse the HTML files.

Here's a complete Python code for the app:

Requirements
Install the necessary libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install beautifulsoup4
Python Code for the App
python
Copy code
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import os

def select_folder():
    folder_path = filedialog.askdirectory()
    if folder_path:
        process_files(folder_path)

def process_files(folder_path):
    # Define the paths to following.html and followers_1.html
    following_path = os.path.join(folder_path, "following.html")
    followers_path = os.path.join(folder_path, "followers_1.html")
    
    if not os.path.exists(following_path) or not os.path.exists(followers_path):
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Required files not found in the selected folder.")
        return
    
    # Parse the HTML files to extract the list of followers and following
    following_list = extract_usernames(following_path)
    followers_list = extract_usernames(followers_path)
    
    # Find non-followers
    non_followers = following_list - followers_list
    
    # Display non-followers
    display_non_followers(non_followers)

def extract_usernames(file_path):
    with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        soup = BeautifulSoup(file, "html.parser")
        
        # Adjust this based on HTML structure - example for extracting links with usernames
        usernames = set(tag.text.strip() for tag in soup.find_all("a", href=True))
        
    return usernames

def display_non_followers(non_followers):
    result_window = tk.Toplevel(root)
    result_window.title("Non-Followers")
    
    if non_followers:
        result_text = "\n".join(non_followers)
    else:
        result_text = "Everyone follows you back!"
    
    text_widget = tk.Text(result_window, wrap="word", width=50, height=20)
    text_widget.insert("1.0", result_text)
    text_widget.config(state="disabled")  # Make text read-only
    text_widget.pack(expand=True, fill="both", padx=10, pady=10)

# Set up the main application window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Non-Followers Finder")

# Add a button to select the folder
select_button = tk.Button(root, text="Select Folder", command=select_folder)
select_button.pack(pady=20)

# Run the application
root.geometry("300x150")
root.mainloop()
How It Works
Folder Selection: Prompts the user to choose a folder.
File Processing: Looks for following.html and followers_1.html in the selected folder.
HTML Parsing: Parses both files to get the usernames using BeautifulSoup.
Non-Followers List: Displays the list of people who don't follow back.
Adjusting the Parsing Logic
If the usernames aren‚Äôt in <a> tags, adjust the extract_usernames function to target the correct HTML elements. You may use other tags or classes based on the HTML structure.

This code will work on macOS and is easily adaptable to other platforms as well. Let me know if you have any questions!

I am super novice to python. How do I open python on mac, where do I paste the code and how do I save and run it?

No problem! Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to running Python code on your Mac:

Step 1: Open a Text Editor
You can use a simple text editor like TextEdit on your Mac, but it‚Äôs better to use a code editor such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text. For now, let's use TextEdit:

Open TextEdit (you can find it in Applications).
Go to Format in the menu and select Make Plain Text. This will save it as a plain .py file instead of a .txt file.
Step 2: Paste the Python Code
Copy the code I provided and paste it into the editor.

Step 3: Save the File
Go to File > Save.
Name the file something like non_followers_finder.py (make sure to include the .py extension).
Choose a location like Desktop or Documents so you can easily find it.
Step 4: Open Terminal
Open Terminal (you can find it by searching in Spotlight or in Applications > Utilities).

In Terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved your file. For example, if you saved it on the Desktop, type:

bash
Copy code
cd Desktop
Press Enter to move into the Desktop directory.

Step 5: Run the Python Code
In Terminal, type the following command:

bash
Copy code
python3 non_followers_finder.py
Then press Enter. This will run your Python script.

Installing Required Libraries
If you see an error about beautifulsoup4 not being installed, you can install it by typing:

bash
Copy code
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
Once installed, run the script again with python3 non_followers_finder.py.

And that‚Äôs it! The program will launch, and you should see the app window open. Let me know if you need any more help!
